# OpenData4Manufacturing

Welcome to the **OpenData4Manufacturing** repository! This repository collects simulation data in JSON and CSV formats for the purpose of reproducibility in manufacturing scheduling experiments.

## Overview

The **OpenData4Manufacturing** repository aims to provide researchers and practitioners with easy access to a variety of simulation datasets related to manufacturing scheduling. By making these datasets publicly available, we hope to facilitate reproducibility and promote further research and experimentation in the field of manufacturing.

## Data Format

The datasets in this repository are available in two formats:
- **JSON**: Structured data format ideal for complex data representation.
- **CSV**: Comma-separated values format, suitable for data analysis and manipulation using various tools and programming languages.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows (upcoming section...)

Each dataset is accompanied by a brief description outlining the specifics of the simulation scenario it represents.

## Usage

To use the datasets in your experiments, simply download the desired files from the relevant directory (`json` or `csv`). Each dataset is self-contained and can be used directly in your simulation or analysis tools.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this repository. If you have simulation datasets that you believe would be beneficial to the community, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your datasets to the appropriate directory (`json` or `csv`).
3. Include a brief description of each dataset.
4. Submit a pull request for review.
